/**
 * Takes a `FetchEvent`, which is received as the first argument in a `fetch`
 * event listener, and returns the three arguments that would be received
 * by the equivalent `fetch` handler in a modules format Cloudflare Worker:
 *
 * 1. `request`, the request being handled; this is the same as `event.request`.
 * 2. `env`, globals available to your handler, like KV namespaces. In the service
 *    worker format, these properties are available on the global object, so this
 *    adaptor returns a proxy that delegates all property accesses to `globalThis`.
 * 3. `context`, which provides some additional functionality to your handler. These
 *    properties are mostly exposed on the `FetchEvent` in the service worker format,
 *    so this function delegates to the event as needed.
 *
 * The result of calling this function can be passed to `createRequestHandler()` and
 * `respondWithAsset()`, which require arguments with the signature of the newer
 * modules format.
